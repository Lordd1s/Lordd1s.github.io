## About Me
I'm a backend developer with a 6 month of hands-on experience, passionate about building APIs, working with asynchronous tasks, and integrating microservices. My primary tech stack is based on Python, and I enjoy working with Django and FastAPI, managing background tasks with Celery and RabbitMQ, and improving performance using Redis and Docker.

## Experience
- **Intern Developer in HardCode** *(April 2024 -- Present)*
- **Payment Service Integration:** Worked on seamless communication between the payment service and the monolith using Django, Celery, RabbitMQ, and FastAPI.  
- **Docker Networking:** Set up Docker networks for improved service-to-service communication.  
- **API Development:** Built APIs for various resources (e.g., products, categories) and implemented JWT token management for user authentication.  
- **Background Tasks:** Automated processes like homework timers using Celery and FastAPI.  
- **Caching Implementation:** Integrated Redis caching into the product catalog, boosting performance.  
- **Microservices:** Developed microservices for managing homework tasks, leveraging Celery for async task management and FastAPI for API endpoints.  
- **Admin & Logging Enhancements:** Customized the admin panel using Django Grappelli and integrated Sentry for logging homework and training tasks.

## Key Projects
- **Payment Status Notifications:** Built a webhook in FastAPI to receive real-time payment status updates from banks.  
- **Homework Timer Automation:** Created a system that starts and stops homework timers automatically via Celery, with WebSocket updates for the frontend.  
- **Product Purchase API:** Developed an endpoint for purchasing products with points, including JWT-based authentication and pagination for user purchase history.  
- **Database & Service Architecture:** Collaborated on the architecture and database design for the payment service using Miro.  
- **Enum Refactor:** Refactored `choices` fields to Enums in user and homework models to improve code clarity and maintenance.
